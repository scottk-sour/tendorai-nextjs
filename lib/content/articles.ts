## Understanding Photocopier Costs in the UK

If you're looking to get a photocopier for your UK business, you've probably discovered that pricing isn't straightforward. Unlike buying a laptop where you pay once and you're done, photocopiers come with ongoing costs that can vary dramatically between suppliers.

This guide breaks down exactly what you'll pay, based on real pricing data from over 70 suppliers across Wales and South West England.

## Lease Costs: What to Expect

Most UK businesses lease their photocopiers rather than buying outright. Here's what monthly lease payments typically look like:

### A4 Mono Devices (Small Office)
- **Entry-level (25-35ppm):** £25-£45/month
- **Mid-range (35-45ppm):** £40-£65/month
- **High-volume (45-55ppm):** £55-£85/month

### A3 Colour MFPs (Standard Office)
- **Entry-level (25-35ppm):** £45-£75/month
- **Mid-range (35-45ppm):** £65-£120/month
- **High-volume (45-60ppm):** £95-£180/month
- **Production (60-80ppm):** £150-£400/month

These figures assume a standard 5-year lease. Shorter terms (3-4 years) typically cost 15-25% more per month.

## Cost Per Copy (CPC) Rates

This is where most businesses get caught out. CPC rates cover toner, maintenance, and parts. Here's what UK suppliers currently charge:

### Mono (Black & White)
- **Budget suppliers:** 0.3p-0.5p per copy
- **Mid-market:** 0.5p-0.8p per copy
- **Premium service:** 0.8p-1.2p per copy

### Colour
- **Budget suppliers:** 2.5p-3.5p per copy
- **Mid-market:** 3.5p-5p per copy
- **Premium service:** 5p-7p per copy

**Key insight:** A difference of just 0.5p per copy on a 10,000 page/month machine equals £600/year. Over a 5-year lease, that's £3,000.

## Total Cost of Ownership Example

Let's look at a real-world example for a typical Cardiff office printing 8,000 pages/month (60% mono, 40% colour):

**Monthly Breakdown:**
- Lease: £89/month (Canon C5540i equivalent)
- Mono CPC: 4,800 pages × 0.5p = £24
- Colour CPC: 3,200 pages × 3.8p = £122
- **Total: £235/month**

**5-Year Total: £14,100**

Now compare a supplier charging higher CPC rates:
- Lease: £75/month (slightly cheaper)
- Mono CPC: 4,800 × 0.8p = £38
- Colour CPC: 3,200 × 5.5p = £176
- **Total: £289/month**

**5-Year Total: £17,340**

The "cheaper" lease ends up costing £3,240 more over 5 years. Always calculate total cost of ownership.

## Hidden Costs to Watch For

### Excess Usage Charges
Most contracts include a monthly page allowance. Exceed it, and you'll pay penalty rates—often 50-100% higher than your standard CPC.

### Minimum Volume Charges
Some suppliers charge a minimum monthly fee even if you print nothing. A £50/month minimum on a quiet month is money wasted.

### Consumables Not Included
Check if staples, hole-punch waste, and drum replacements are included. Some suppliers exclude these.

### Delivery and Installation
Should be free for new contracts, but some suppliers charge £100-£300.

### Training
Basic training should be included. Advanced workflow training might cost extra.

### End of Lease Charges
Collection fees, data wiping, and "fair wear and tear" charges can add £200-£500 at contract end.

## Lease vs Buy: Quick Comparison

| Factor | Lease | Buy |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Upfront cost | Low (first month only) | High (£3,000-£15,000) |
| Monthly cost | Fixed, predictable | Toner only |
| Maintenance | Included | Extra (£300-£800/year) |
| Cash flow | Preserves capital | Large initial outlay |
| Tax treatment | 100% OpEx deductible | CapEx depreciation |
| Technology refresh | Easy upgrade at end | Stuck with old machine |

For most SMEs, leasing makes more sense unless you have specific reasons to own the equipment.

## How to Get the Best Price

1. **Get multiple quotes.** Prices vary 30-50% between suppliers for identical machines.

2. **Negotiate CPC rates.** There's more margin here than on the lease. Ask for 10-15% off quoted rates.

3. **Check the small print.** Minimum volumes, excess charges, and contract length all matter.

4. **Consider local suppliers.** They often match national dealer prices but with better response times.

5. **Time your purchase.** End of quarter (March, June, September, December) often brings better deals.

## The Lease vs Buy Decision

Every business replacing their copier faces this question: should we lease or buy? There's no universal answer—it depends on your cash position, printing volume, tax situation, and how quickly you want to refresh technology.

Here's how to make the right choice for your business.

## The Case for Leasing

### Preserve Cash Flow
A mid-range A3 colour MFP costs £4,000-£8,000 to buy outright. Leasing spreads this over 3-5 years at £80-£150/month. For most SMEs, keeping that capital in the business makes sense.

### Predictable Monthly Costs
Lease agreements bundle the machine, maintenance, toner, and repairs into one fixed monthly payment. No surprises. If the machine breaks, it's the supplier's problem.

### Tax Advantages
Lease payments are 100% tax-deductible as an operating expense. You reduce your taxable profit by the full amount each year.

With purchasing, you claim capital allowances—currently 100% first-year allowances for most equipment under the Annual Investment Allowance (AIA). But if your profits are low, you might not benefit fully.

### Technology Refresh
Copier technology improves every 3-4 years. Leasing lets you upgrade at contract end without being stuck with outdated equipment you own.

### Included Maintenance
Lease agreements include all maintenance, parts, and toner (except paper). When you buy, you either pay for a separate maintenance contract (£300-£800/year) or handle repairs yourself.

## The Case for Buying

### Lower Total Cost (Sometimes)
If you print moderate volumes and keep equipment for 7+ years, buying can work out cheaper. But this assumes:
- Low repair costs (not guaranteed for older machines)
- Stable printing needs (no technology obsolescence)
- Disciplined toner purchasing (avoiding overpriced OEM cartridges)

### No Contract Lock-In
Lease contracts run 3-5 years with hefty early termination fees (typically 80% of remaining payments). Buying gives you flexibility to change suppliers or technology whenever you want.

### Asset Ownership
You own the equipment. It has residual value (though copiers depreciate quickly—a 5-year-old machine is worth 10-20% of its purchase price).

### Better for Very Low Volume
If you print under 1,000 pages/month, the minimum charges on most lease contracts make buying more economical.

## Financial Comparison

Let's compare a Canon imageRUNNER ADVANCE C5540i (mid-range A3 colour MFP) over 5 years, printing 5,000 pages/month:

### Leasing
- Monthly lease + CPC: £145/month
- **5-year total: £8,700**

### Buying
- Purchase price: £5,500
- Maintenance contract: £400/year × 5 = £2,000
- Toner costs (at typical CPC equivalent): £3,500
- **5-year total: £11,000**

In this example, leasing saves £2,300. But if you kept the purchased machine for 8 years, the maths shifts in favour of buying.

## Questions to Ask Yourself

### 1. What's your monthly print volume?
- Under 1,000 pages: Consider buying a smaller device
- 1,000-10,000 pages: Leasing usually wins
- Over 10,000 pages: Definitely lease—maintenance costs for high-volume purchased machines are unpredictable

### 2. How important is cash flow?
If preserving working capital matters, lease. If you have cash sitting idle, buying might make sense.

### 3. How long will you keep the machine?
- 3-5 years: Lease
- 7+ years: Consider buying (if you're disciplined about maintenance)

### 4. Do you want hassle-free operation?
Lease agreements include everything. When you own, you're responsible for maintenance contracts, toner purchasing, and repairs.

### 5. Is your business growing?
If printing needs might double in 2 years, lease. You can upgrade without being stuck with an undersized machine you own.

## The Hybrid Approach

Some suppliers offer "fair value" leases—you can buy the equipment at market value at contract end. This gives you the benefits of leasing (predictable costs, included maintenance) with the option to own if the machine still meets your needs.

## Our Recommendation

For most UK SMEs printing 2,000-15,000 pages/month, **leasing is the better choice**. The predictable costs, included maintenance, and technology refresh options outweigh the slightly higher total cost.

Buy only if:
- You print very low volumes (<1,000 pages/month)
- You have excess cash with no better use
- You specifically need to own the asset for accounting reasons

## The UK Phone System Revolution

If your business still uses traditional landlines, you need to act. Openreach is switching off the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) by December 2027. After that, traditional phone lines simply won't work.

This isn't a scare tactic—it's infrastructure reality. The copper network that's carried phone calls since the Victorian era is being retired. Everything moves to digital.

The good news? VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) phone systems are cheaper, more flexible, and packed with features that traditional systems can't match.

## How VoIP Works

Traditional phones send voice as electrical signals over copper wires. VoIP converts voice into data packets sent over your internet connection—the same way you'd stream a video or send an email.

You need:
- A reliable broadband connection (minimum 1Mbps per concurrent call)
- VoIP phones (desk phones or softphone apps)
- A VoIP provider (who routes your calls and provides features)

That's it. No expensive PBX hardware. No telephone engineer visits. No line rental to Openreach.

## Cost Comparison

### Traditional System (10 Users)
- PBX hardware: £2,000-£5,000
- Desk phones: £80-£150 each = £800-£1,500
- Line rental: £15-£25/line × 4 lines = £60-£100/month
- Call charges: £50-£150/month
- Maintenance: £200-£500/year
- **5-year total: £12,000-£20,000**

### VoIP System (10 Users)
- Hardware: £0 (use existing phones or softphones)
- IP desk phones (if wanted): £50-£100 each = £500-£1,000
- Monthly subscription: £8-£15/user = £80-£150/month
- Calls: Often included or heavily discounted
- Maintenance: £0 (cloud-managed)
- **5-year total: £5,000-£10,000**

VoIP typically costs 40-60% less than traditional systems.

## Features You Get with VoIP

### Standard Features (Usually Included)
- **Voicemail to email:** Missed calls sent as audio files to your inbox
- **Call forwarding:** Route calls to mobiles when out of office
- **Auto-attendant:** "Press 1 for Sales, 2 for Support..."
- **Call recording:** Essential for training and compliance
- **Hold music:** Professional image while customers wait
- **Call queues:** Manage busy periods without engaged tones
- **Video calling:** Built-in to most VoIP systems
- **Mobile apps:** Take your business line anywhere

### Advanced Features (Often Included or Low Cost)
- **CRM integration:** Caller info pops up automatically
- **Microsoft Teams integration:** One platform for calls and collaboration
- **Analytics:** See call volumes, wait times, missed calls
- **Call whisper:** Managers can coach staff during calls
- **IVR (Interactive Voice Response):** Sophisticated call routing

With traditional systems, many of these features require expensive add-ons or aren't available at all.

## The PSTN Switch-Off: What You Need to Know

### Timeline
- **Now:** Openreach has stopped selling new PSTN lines
- **September 2025:** Stop-sell on all legacy products
- **December 2027:** Full switch-off—PSTN lines stop working

### What's Affected
- Traditional landlines
- ISDN lines
- Alarm systems using phone lines
- Payment terminals using phone lines
- Fax machines (yes, some businesses still use them)

### What You Need to Do
1. Audit your current phone setup
2. Check your broadband can handle VoIP
3. Choose a VoIP provider
4. Port your numbers (you can keep existing numbers)
5. Install and test before switch-off

Don't wait until 2027. Providers will be overwhelmed with last-minute migrations. Act in 2026 to get proper support and avoid disruption.

## Choosing a VoIP Provider

### Key Questions to Ask
1. **What's included in the monthly fee?** Some providers charge extra for basic features.
2. **How reliable is the service?** Look for 99.9%+ uptime guarantees.
3. **Where's support based?** UK-based support resolves issues faster.
4. **Can I keep my numbers?** Number porting should be free.
5. **What hardware do I need?** Some providers work with any SIP phone; others lock you into their hardware.
6. **What's the contract length?** Monthly rolling is ideal; avoid 3+ year lock-ins.

### UK VoIP Providers to Consider
- **8x8:** Enterprise features, good Teams integration
- **RingCentral:** Popular for mid-sized businesses
- **3CX:** Flexible, can self-host
- **Gamma Horizon:** UK-focused, reliable
- **Vonage:** Good API integrations
- **Local providers:** Often better support and competitive pricing

## Common Concerns (And Reality)

### "What if the internet goes down?"
Modern VoIP systems can failover to mobile apps automatically. You can also add a 4G backup connection for critical businesses.

### "Call quality will be worse"
On decent broadband (50Mbps+), VoIP call quality matches or exceeds traditional lines. Issues only arise on very poor connections.

### "It's complicated to set up"
Cloud VoIP systems are plug-and-play. You can often self-install desk phones in minutes.

### "We'll lose our phone number"
Number porting is standard. Your existing number moves to VoIP seamlessly.

## Next Steps

The PSTN switch-off isn't optional. Every UK business needs to move to VoIP eventually—the only question is when.

Moving now means:
- Lower costs immediately
- Better features today
- No last-minute panic in 2027
- Proper time for staff training

## What Is Cost Per Copy?

Cost Per Copy (CPC)—sometimes called Cost Per Page or Click Charge—is the amount you pay for each page printed or copied. It covers toner, maintenance, and parts.

CPC is separate from your lease payment. A £60/month lease plus 0.5p mono CPC and 4p colour CPC means your total monthly bill depends on how much you print.

Understanding CPC rates is crucial because small differences compound dramatically over a contract term.

## 2026 UK Average CPC Rates

Based on analysis of pricing from 70+ suppliers across Wales and South West England:

### A4 Mono (Black & White)
| Tier | Rate | Who Pays This |
|------|------|---------------|
| Competitive | 0.3p-0.4p | High-volume contracts, good negotiators |
| Average | 0.5p-0.6p | Most SME contracts |
| High | 0.7p-1.0p | Low-volume contracts, poor deals |

### A4 Colour
| Tier | Rate | Who Pays This |
|------|------|---------------|
| Competitive | 2.5p-3.2p | High-volume contracts, good negotiators |
| Average | 3.5p-4.5p | Most SME contracts |
| High | 5p-7p | Low-volume contracts, poor deals |

### A3 Rates
A3 pages are typically charged at 2× the A4 rate. So 0.5p A4 mono = 1p A3 mono.

## What Affects Your CPC Rate?

### 1. Monthly Volume
Higher volumes = lower rates. A business printing 20,000 pages/month gets better rates than one printing 2,000.

| Monthly Volume | Typical Mono CPC |
|----------------|------------------|
| Under 2,000 | 0.7p-1.0p |
| 2,000-5,000 | 0.5p-0.7p |
| 5,000-10,000 | 0.4p-0.6p |
| 10,000-20,000 | 0.35p-0.5p |
| Over 20,000 | 0.3p-0.4p |

### 2. Colour Ratio
If you print mostly colour, suppliers may lower colour CPC but increase mono rates (or vice versa). Check your actual print mix.

### 3. Machine Type
Higher-end machines often come with lower CPC rates because they're more efficient and reliable.

### 4. Contract Length
Longer contracts (5 years vs 3 years) usually get better CPC rates. But you're locked in longer.

### 5. Negotiation
CPC rates have more margin than lease payments. Suppliers expect negotiation. Don't accept first-quoted rates.

## The Real Cost Impact

Let's see how CPC differences affect total cost for a business printing 8,000 pages/month (50% mono, 50% colour):

### Scenario A: Good Rates
- Mono: 4,000 × 0.4p = £16
- Colour: 4,000 × 3.2p = £128
- **Monthly CPC: £144**
- **Annual: £1,728**

### Scenario B: Average Rates
- Mono: 4,000 × 0.6p = £24
- Colour: 4,000 × 4.5p = £180
- **Monthly CPC: £204**
- **Annual: £2,448**

### Scenario C: Poor Rates
- Mono: 4,000 × 0.8p = £32
- Colour: 4,000 × 5.5p = £220
- **Monthly CPC: £252**
- **Annual: £3,024**

**Difference between good and poor: £1,296/year or £6,480 over 5 years.**

That's enough to lease a second machine.

## Red Flags in CPC Contracts

### Minimum Volume Charges
"Minimum 5,000 pages/month at quoted CPC rate." If you print less, you pay for 5,000 anyway. Fine if you consistently hit the minimum; expensive if you don't.

### Excess Rates
What happens if you exceed your allowance? Some contracts charge 50-100% more per page over the limit. Get this in writing.

### Colour Definition
Is "colour" any page with any colour, or only pages that are predominantly colour? A page with a small logo might be charged as colour. Check the terms.

### Excluded Items
Some contracts exclude staples, waste containers, or drum units. These "extras" add up.

### Annual Increases
Many contracts allow CPC increases tied to inflation. A 3% annual increase on 4p colour becomes 4.64p by year 5.

## How to Negotiate Better CPC Rates

1. **Know your actual volumes.** Check your current machine's page counter. Accurate data = leverage.

2. **Get multiple quotes.** The biggest leverage is a competitive offer from another supplier.

3. **Focus on total cost.** Some suppliers quote low lease + high CPC. Calculate total cost of ownership.

4. **Lock rates for the contract term.** Avoid annual increase clauses if possible.

5. **Ask about volume breaks.** "If we grow to 15,000 pages/month, does CPC drop?"

6. **Negotiate at renewal.** Suppliers are most flexible when you can walk away.

## Benchmarking Your Current Contract

If you have an existing copier contract, check your invoices for CPC rates. Compare against our averages:

| Your Rate | vs Average | Action |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| Below average | Good deal | Keep it, negotiate same at renewal |
| Average | Acceptable | Room for improvement at renewal |
| Above average | Overpaying | Get competitive quotes now |

Even mid-contract, knowing you're overpaying helps you plan for renewal and avoid auto-renewal traps.

## Why Businesses Need CCTV

CCTV isn't just about catching criminals after the fact. Modern systems provide:

- **Deterrence:** Visible cameras reduce theft, vandalism, and break-ins by 50-70%
- **Evidence:** High-quality footage for insurance claims and police investigations
- **Staff safety:** Monitoring lone workers, car parks, and high-risk areas
- **Operations insight:** See customer flow, queue lengths, and efficiency issues
- **Remote monitoring:** Check on premises from anywhere via smartphone
- **Insurance discounts:** Many insurers offer 5-15% premium reductions for CCTV

## UK Legal Requirements

Operating CCTV comes with legal obligations. Getting this wrong can result in fines up to £17.5 million under GDPR.

### ICO Requirements
The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) sets rules for CCTV use:

1. **Legitimate purpose:** You must have a valid reason (security, safety, not staff spying)
2. **Signage:** Clear signs stating CCTV is in operation and who to contact
3. **Data protection:** Footage is personal data—treat it accordingly
4. **Proportionality:** Don't record more than necessary (e.g., don't point cameras at neighbours)
5. **Retention limits:** Only keep footage as long as needed (typically 30 days)
6. **Subject access:** Anyone recorded can request to see footage of themselves (respond within 1 month)

### Signage Requirements
Your CCTV signs must include:
- Statement that CCTV is in use
- Purpose of recording
- Contact details for the data controller
- Organisation name if not obvious

Generic "CCTV in operation" signs without contact details don't meet requirements.

### Staff Monitoring
Recording employees is permitted for legitimate purposes (theft prevention, safety) but:
- Staff must be informed
- You can't record private areas (toilets, changing rooms)
- Audio recording has stricter rules—often not permitted without explicit consent

## Types of CCTV Systems

### Analogue vs IP Cameras

**Analogue (Traditional)**
- Lower resolution (typically up to 1080p)
- Requires coaxial cabling
- Cheaper upfront
- Limited features
- Being phased out

**IP (Network) Cameras**
- High resolution (2K, 4K, 8K available)
- Uses network cabling (CAT5e/CAT6) or WiFi
- Advanced features (analytics, search, integration)
- Higher initial cost but better long-term value
- The modern standard

**Recommendation:** Always choose IP cameras for new installations. The quality and feature difference is substantial.

### Camera Types

**Bullet Cameras**
- Cylindrical shape, usually weatherproof
- Good for outdoor perimeter monitoring
- Visible deterrent
- Fixed viewing angle

**Dome Cameras**
- Discrete ceiling-mounted design
- Good for indoor use
- Harder to tell which direction they're pointing
- Vandal-resistant options available

**PTZ Cameras (Pan-Tilt-Zoom)**
- Remotely controllable direction and zoom
- Can follow movement
- Cover large areas
- Higher cost, best for key locations

**Turret Cameras**
- Ball-and-socket mount for flexible positioning
- Good balance of features and cost
- Popular for general-purpose use

### Recording Options

**NVR (Network Video Recorder)**
- On-premise box stores footage locally
- One-time hardware cost
- You control the data
- Requires physical security and maintenance
- Typical storage: 2-8TB (2-4 weeks of footage)

**Cloud Recording**
- Footage stored in the cloud
- Monthly subscription fee
- Access from anywhere
- Provider handles security and redundancy
- No hardware to maintain
- Higher long-term cost

**Hybrid**
- Local NVR plus cloud backup
- Best of both worlds
- Redundancy if on-site recorder is stolen/damaged

## Typical Costs

### Small Business (4-8 Cameras)
- **IP cameras:** £100-£250 each = £400-£2,000
- **NVR:** £200-£500
- **Installation:** £500-£1,500
- **Cabling:** Included or £50-£100 per camera
- **Total:** £1,500-£4,500

### Medium Business (8-16 Cameras)
- **IP cameras:** £100-£300 each = £800-£4,800
- **NVR:** £400-£1,000
- **Installation:** £1,500-£4,000
- **Total:** £3,500-£12,000

### Large/Complex Sites (16+ Cameras)
- Bespoke pricing based on requirements
- Typically £10,000-£50,000+
- Often includes analytics, access control integration

### Ongoing Costs
- **Maintenance:** £100-£500/year (cleaning, checks, firmware updates)
- **Cloud storage (if used):** £5-£20/camera/month
- **Monitoring service (if used):** £50-£500/month

## Key Features to Consider

### Resolution
- **1080p (Full HD):** Minimum acceptable standard
- **2K (1440p):** Good balance of quality and storage
- **4K (2160p):** Excellent detail, ideal for facial recognition, uses more storage
- **Higher resolutions:** Rarely necessary for most businesses

### Night Vision
- **Infrared (IR):** Standard night vision, black & white footage
- **Starlight/Low-light:** Better colour reproduction in dim conditions
- **Supplemental lighting:** White light cameras deter intruders but may disturb neighbours

### Storage Calculation
Rule of thumb: 1TB stores roughly 8-10 days of footage from 4× 1080p cameras at 15fps.

For 4K cameras or higher frame rates, multiply storage needs by 4×.

### Smart Features
Modern IP cameras offer:
- **Motion detection:** Only record when something moves
- **Line crossing:** Alert when someone crosses a virtual boundary
- **Facial recognition:** Identify known individuals
- **Number plate recognition:** Track vehicles
- **Object detection:** Distinguish people, vehicles, animals
- **Searchable footage:** Find "person wearing red" without watching hours of video

## Choosing an Installer

### Questions to Ask
1. Are you NSI or SSAIB accredited? (Industry standards)
2. Do you offer a maintenance contract?
3. What warranty do you provide?
4. Can I access footage remotely?
5. What happens if the system fails—what's your response time?
6. Do you provide training on using the system?
7. Will you help with ICO compliance (signage, documentation)?

### Red Flags
- No accreditation
- Pushing proprietary systems that lock you in
- No maintenance options
- Vague answers on data retention and access
- Pressure to buy more cameras than you need

## Installation Checklist

1. **Site survey:** Professional assessment of coverage needs
2. **Camera positions:** Cover entry points, high-value areas, blind spots
3. **Lighting:** Consider existing lighting and camera capabilities
4. **Cabling routes:** Plan neat, hidden cable runs
5. **Recorder location:** Secure, ventilated, accessible for maintenance
6. **Power:** Cameras need power—PoE (Power over Ethernet) simplifies installation
7. **Network:** Ensure bandwidth for viewing and cloud backup
8. **Signage:** Order compliant signs before installation
9. **Training:** Know how to use the system before the installer leaves
10. **Documentation:** Retain system details, passwords, and data protection documentation

## When to Consider Switching

You don't need to wait for contract end to evaluate your options. Start looking if:

- **Service has declined:** Slow response times, unresolved issues, missed SLAs
- **Costs have crept up:** Annual increases, excess charges, hidden fees
- **Technology is outdated:** Your equipment no longer meets business needs
- **Business has changed:** You've grown, shrunk, or relocated
- **Better options exist:** Competitors offer more for less
- **Communication is poor:** Can't reach your account manager, nobody knows your setup

## 6 Months Before Contract End

### Step 1: Audit Your Current Setup

**Document everything:**
- Contract end date (check auto-renewal clauses!)
- Current monthly costs (lease, CPC, line rental, subscriptions)
- Equipment serial numbers and locations
- Actual usage (page counts, call volumes, data usage)
- Pain points and feature gaps
- Support ticket history

**Calculate true cost of ownership:**
Don't just look at the headline figure. Include:
- Monthly recurring charges
- Overage fees
- Service call costs (if any)
- Staff time dealing with issues

### Step 2: Check Your Contract Terms

**Auto-renewal clauses:**
Many contracts auto-renew for another term (often 12 months) if you don't give notice. Common notice periods are 90 days.

**Early termination:**
If you want to leave mid-contract, you'll typically owe 80-100% of remaining payments. Sometimes negotiable if moving to a better deal.

**Equipment return:**
Who pays for collection? Is there a "fair wear and tear" clause that could trigger charges?

**Data/content:**
For telecoms/IT: Who owns your phone numbers? Email archives? How do you get your data back?

### Step 3: Get Competitive Quotes

**What to include in your RFQ:**
- Current equipment/services
- Actual usage data
- Pain points to solve
- Nice-to-have features
- Locations and users
- Contract length preferences

**Get at least 3 quotes:**
Prices vary 30-50% between suppliers for similar solutions. The effort pays off.

**Compare like-for-like:**
Make sure all quotes include the same scope. One supplier's "all-inclusive" might exclude items another includes.

### Step 4: Negotiate with Your Incumbent

Armed with competitive quotes, approach your current supplier:

"Our contract is ending in 3 months. I've received quotes from [competitors] that offer [better price / better features / better service]. What can you do to retain our business?"

Often, suppliers offer their best deals to prevent churn. But only negotiate if you're genuinely open to staying—burning bridges helps no one.

## 1 Month Before Contract End

### Step 5: Plan the Transition

**Agree transition dates:**
- Old service end date
- New service start date
- Overlap period (recommended: 1-2 weeks)

**Coordinate both suppliers:**
The new supplier handles installation. The old supplier handles removal. Make sure they're not scheduled for the same time.

**Plan for downtime:**
Even with careful planning, expect some disruption:
- Copiers: 1-2 hours for swap (often can be done outside hours)
- Telecoms: 1-4 hours for number porting (can sometimes be seamless)
- IT systems: Varies widely—could be weekends or phased migration

### Step 6: Handle the Details

**For copiers:**
- Retrieve any documents left in scanner/print trays
- Note current page counts for final billing
- Get data wiped from hard drives (ask for certificate)
- Return all accessories (staple cartridges, paper trays)

**For telecoms:**
- Port your numbers (start this early—can take 10-30 days)
- Update any systems that use your old numbers
- Inform key contacts of any number changes
- Set up call forwarding during transition if needed

**For IT:**
- Data migration and verification
- User account setup
- Integration testing
- Staff training on new systems

## Go-Live Day

### What to Expect

**Before the switch:**
- Final backup of everything
- Staff briefed on what's happening
- Key contacts have mobile numbers for emergencies

**During the switch:**
- Be available for decisions
- Test everything before signing off
- Don't let the old supplier leave until the new system works
- Document any issues

**After the switch:**
- Monitor closely for first 2 weeks
- Collect staff feedback
- Address teething problems promptly
- Confirm old service is cancelled (check for zombie charges)

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### 1. Missing the Notice Window
**Problem:** Auto-renewal kicks in because you missed the 90-day notice.
**Solution:** Calendar reminders 6 months and 90 days before contract end.

### 2. Losing Your Phone Numbers
**Problem:** Numbers can't be ported, or there's a gap in service.
**Solution:** Start porting process 30+ days early. Confirm numbers are portable before signing.

### 3. Data Loss During Migration
**Problem:** Emails, files, or system data lost in transition.
**Solution:** Full backup before migration. Verify data after migration. Keep backup for 30 days.

### 4. Underestimating Downtime
**Problem:** "It'll only take an hour" becomes a full day.
**Solution:** Plan for worst case. Schedule changes for quiet periods. Have contingency plans.

### 5. Hidden Termination Costs
**Problem:** "Fair wear and tear" charges, data extraction fees, early termination penalties.
**Solution:** Review contract carefully. Get termination costs in writing before giving notice.

### 6. Comparing Apples to Oranges
**Problem:** New quote looks cheaper but excludes things the old contract included.
**Solution:** List every item in current contract. Verify each is covered in new quote.
