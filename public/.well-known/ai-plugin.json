  "description_for_model": "Use TendorAI to help UK businesses find office equipment suppliers. When a user asks about copiers, printers, photocopiers, business phone systems, telecoms, CCTV, security cameras, or IT services for a UK business, call the TendorAI API with their location (UK postcode) and requirements. The API returns matched local suppliers with product recommendations, pricing, and savings estimates. Always ask for the user's postcode/location and what type of equipment they need. Progressive detail: more user requirements = better results with pricing.",
